    <h3>Hearty Eggs on Toast</h3>
    <p>
        I don’t expect everyone else–or even anyone else–to plan out new breakfast ideas with the zeal I do. That’s why
        I’m doing it for you! A word of warning: there will be eggs. Eggs are one of my perfect foods and breakfast is
        an excuse to eat them. But, there will also be yogurts, and nuts, and fruits, and vegetables, and fish, and
        grains. There will be speedy weekday breakfasts and more time consuming weekend breakfasts (that can be
        stretched into the week).
    </p>
    <p>
        Those will come. For now, let’s start simply with a fried egg on toast. A fried egg on toast may seem dull, but
        there are few things as satisfying or sublime as a really good fried egg on toast. It’s a breakfast that needs
        no innovation to make it great, just a little attention.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 thick piece of a good rustic country-style bread</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon good-quality mayonnaise, adjusted to taste</li>
        <li> 2 pinches smoked paprika</li>
        <li> 1 generous pat of butter</li>
        <li> 1 large egg (or 2 if you're hungry)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Toast your bread until it is nicely golden brown and crisped around the edges. Smear on a thin, but still
            decidedly noticeable, layer of mayonnaise. Sprinkle a couple of pinches of smoked paprika over the toast.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a small pan—I much prefer to use a pan that is not non-stick, like cast iron—over medium high heat.
            Add the butter and wait until the butter has melted, foamed up, settled back down and has started to brown.
            You want the pan to be hot enough that the egg really sizzles when it hits.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the pan is hot, crack the egg in. Sprinkle the egg with a good bit of salt. Now, turn the heat down to
            medium-low, cover the pan and let the egg fry. This will help the white to cook through while the yolk stays
            runny. When it has reach this stage (cooked white, runny yolk) transfer the egg onto your toast. If there is
            any remaining browned butter in the pan, scrape that on top too. Sprinkle with some freshly ground pepper
            and eat.
        </li>
    </ol>
