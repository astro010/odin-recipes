    <h3>Mouth-Watering Steak</h3>
    <p>
        Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s one that all steak lovers should know because
        it’s easy, worthy of using on high quality steaks and also a way to really elevate economical steaks
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in butter, garlic and thyme and baste
        continuously as the steak finishes cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter does all sorts of wonderful things
        to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to the crust of the steak.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 – 2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet ,</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot – you should see smoke!
        </li>
        <li>Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the
            skillet.</li>
        <li>Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.</li>
        <li>Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme. BE
            CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter!</li>
        <li>Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it’s cooked to
            your liking – 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F, chart below for other doneness
            temps)</li>
        <li>Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it
            browned more.</li>
        <li>Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed
            Potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
