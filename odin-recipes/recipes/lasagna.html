    <h3>Delicious Lasagna</h3>
    <p> Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a
        potluck.
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>
        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking
        since his
        college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is
        posted
        here will easily serve eight people.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck </li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup) </li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup) </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce </li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can) </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce,
            tomato paste,
            and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded
            mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great
            flavor!
        </li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed
            by a
            layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
